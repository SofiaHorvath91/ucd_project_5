### 2. Agile Process Overview
The project was developed in 5 sprints with 5 milestone dates. During the development process, the expectations were mapped to user stories with related user acceptance criteria(s), with associated story points (scale from 10 to 50) and with related tasks to perform, each story belonging to one or more from the 5 epics, a group of stories targeting the same area of development. High-importance user stories were marked as priorities in order to set up an order of execution.
The aim was to finalize each iteration for the determined milestone, which means the completion of the tasks related to the user stories which are associated to the given iteration until the deadline. The iterations include user stories belonging to more epics, but each iteration has a higher focus on a given epic, mirroring the development of the work. During the finalisation of the user stories belonging to an iteration, the high-priority user stories got more focus and higher level of attention.
### 3. Agile Tools
During the development, regarding tight time-frame, the classic method was used with table and post-its, however for better presentation, the development process was translated to Github tools.
* [Github Project = Work Projects (5)](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_5/projects?type=classic)
  * To represent the status of the project at the end of each iteration, so at each milestone, 5 projects were created to illustrate the status of 40 same taks upon iteration milestone.
* [Github Milestones = Iterations / Sprints (5)](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_5/milestones)
  * Milestones were used to represent a work sprint with precised deadline which is served to keep in line the project development in order to respect the final deadline. During each iteration of the work, a different epic was prioritised, allowing the timely build of the full site and the continous testing from the beginning.
  * The 5 iterations : Iteration 0 / Iteration 1 / Iteration 2 / Iteration 3 / Iteration 4
* [Github Issues = User stories (40)](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_5/issues?q=)
  * Issues were used to represent user stories. A user story contains the description of the story ('as a ... I can ... so that ...'), the related epic(s), the corresponding user story points, the related tasks and the user acceptance criteria(s). Each story belongs to a milestone sprint (iteration), and each story is labeled based on related epic(s), and high-priority stories are further labeled as priorities. All stories are assigned to admin / site owner.
* [Github Labels = Epics (5) +  High-Priority user stories (14)](https://github.com/SofiaHorvath91/ucd_project_5/labels)
  * Labels were used to connect user stories to one or more of the 5 epics, which are groups of stories targeting the same aspect of development. Each epic is represented by a label colored differently to be able to better distinct them, and the 5 epic together include all kind of works which should be done to build the application.
  * The 5 epics : Admin-specific Action / Feedback / Main Functionality / Site Structure / User Authentication
  * Labels were also used to create a Priority label to be able to tag high-priority user stories which require more attention and work, as they concern the core functionnalities of the site.

## UX
### 1. Strategy
* Purpose of Project
  * To make sure users have an appealing and safe online place to spend some quality time
  * To have users browse and purchase books of various genres
  * To allow users leave their toughts / recommendations for further site improvement.
  * To allow users share the site and follow content if interested.
  * To give users the chance to discover new stories.
### 2. Scope
* I wanted a simple, evident and user-friendly UX experience.
* I wanted clear and informative content.
* I wanted a visually appealing, yet solid design.
* I wanted interesting site name and a matching theme.
* I wanted smooth and interactive e-commerce and input providing experience.
### 3. Structure
* The layout is simple and clear to ensure the easy navigation through site content by users
* The navigation bar is clear, fixed, visible and responsive with matching site logo and with current shopping bag's total displayed.
* The content is easy to read, online purchase/checkout and feedback/subscription functions are smooth with self-explanatory steps.
* The Home page displays clearly the site’s main subject, allows to explore site content, and appeal visitors to stay and sign up / login to discover.
* The Login / Sign Up pages allows users to register or to connect if already registered, via standard form or vi social account.
* The Logout page allows logged in users to disconnect from site.
* The Books page allows logged in users to browse / sort / search books, optionally in a specific category.
* The Book Detail page allows logged in users to consult details of present book and to place it in shopping bag with selected quantity.

* In the Footer, users can find copyrights.
### 4. Skeleton
The very basic skeleton of the site was modelled by Wireframes via Balsamiq, and during site development, additional design elements was added for better UX.

### 5. Style
* Design & Colours
  * When planning the project, I wanted a simple, yet unique and creative design to attract users but to not to distract attention from site functionalities, so I chose black-white design with artistic and attention-catching background and logo. I did not want to select another primary color as it makes the colorful book covers more outstanding, and as being aware about the symbolism of colors, I wanted to avoid any categorization and emphasize that the site is for every age and gender.
* Font Selection
  * The main font type was chosen with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and is used across the whole of the website: [Philosopher](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Philosopher). This is a well readable, yet elegant and slightly artistic font type which I found suitable as it outlines the magical and special site theme.
### 6. Code Structure and Database
* Code Structure\
The project is consisted of 7 applications, built by using the Django Framework. The business logic is executed by the cooperation of these applications, based on the ucd_project_5 project-wide settings, using the static resources like HTML page frame / CSS stylesheet / Javascript-jQuery script / Images.\
The application is completed by the following files/directories :
  * ucd_project_5: Containing settings.py (Settings) / urls.py (Website urls) / WSGI-ASGI configruations
  * dailybook: Appication containing MVC logic of filling out daily book quiz and get corresponding result (quiz / result pages)

* Database\
The website is a data-centric one with frontend built with HTML, Javascript, CSS along with Bootstrap framework.
The backend consists of Python built with the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed Heroku version (Production).
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an open source object-relational database system with powerful features.
[SQLLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database was used for local development and testing.
### 7. Database Models
The following models were created to represent the database model structure for the website (visual schema made by [DbDesigner](https://app.dbdesigner.net/)):\
![Database models' visual schema](/static/readme/database_models_schema.PNG)
* User Model
  * The User model contains information about the user. It is part of the Django social auth library. As no particular customization was needed ofr User model, get_user_model() lazy loading was used.
  * Connected to Profile (via OneToOne relation) / Result (via OneToOne relation) / Feedback (via OneToOne relation) / Recommendation (via OneToOne relation)
* Profile (Profiles application)
  * Capture delivery details of user to be used for proceeding purchase order
  * Connected to User (via OneToOne relation) / Order (via OneToOne relation)
* Order (Checkout application)
  * Capture details of purchase order of books with general user / delivery / financial details
  * Connected to OrderLineItem (via OneToMany relation) / Profile (via OneToOne relation)
* OrderLineItem (Checkout application)
  * Capture details of book to purchase, including related order, related book, quantity and subtotal
  * Connected to Order (via OneToMany relation) / Book (via OneToOne relation)

### 5. Manual tests
* Desktop\
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge: pages are working fine and have the corresponding style, social login works as expected.
* Mobile\
Tested with Samsung A5, Galaxy Fold, iPhone 5, and iPad, and webpage works well, responsive as intended and no style deformations.
* Mozilla Developer Tools\
Tested for available devices, webpage works well, responsive as intended, no style deformations and no error messages in Pycharm debug tool.
### 6. Accessibility tests
The pages available before login were verified about accessibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) as Wave cannot handle login feature. Few stylistic errors found (low contrast errors for color), alerts related to heading elements hierarchy, four errors for empty label (global search function, needed for style). As other pages are very similar in terms of HTML-Styling, same results are assumed for them too.

### 7. Bugs and Solution
While building the application and fulfilling requirements, I firstly could not create sitemap when books were loaded to the database, as too many URLs exceeded allowed limit. Therefore I delete records and upon creating site map, I reloaded them from fixture. Upon reloading books, I also noted and implemented null-value exception for random book to display on home page (handle if no books available).
I also had problems with order number field, as upon changing to UUID from Char field for better handling, order records could not be loaded. To solve error, I deleted migrations and reset database, then after first new migration with updated field, model was not touched or remigrated.
I also encountered the difficulty while trying to allow the update of delivery address from user profile and to send confirmation email, so due to time frame and that these functions are important, but not vital, they were moved to future features.
## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku (find it [here](https://serene-citadel-08400.herokuapp.com/)) while building it with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and pushing it to GitHub Repository and Heroku via [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
